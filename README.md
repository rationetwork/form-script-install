# Clear Choice Setup 

Get set up with a form and / or results that you can use to introduce your site's visitors to Choose Wiselyâ€™s award winning personal loan comparison service.

- No API calls.
- No iFrames.
- No REST responses.

It works by running a stand-alone application form on your site. Your visitors complete the form and are then redirected to a comparison table powered by Choose Wisely where we will match them with their best available options.  
 
## Get Started
Your code snippet comes in two parts. 
### Part 1, Container Tag
Paste this where you want the form to run on your site.

```html
<div id="ccApply"></div>
```

### Part 2, The Script
Paste this just before the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
    <script type="text/javascript">
      window.clearChoice_conf = window.clearChoice_conf || {};
      clearChoice_conf = {
        key: 'your-affiliate-key-goes-here',
        ref: 'your-affiliate-reference-goes-here', // Optional
        elemId: 'ccApply', // Container tag id
	theme: 'ChooseWisely' // Optional
      };
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://3pi.choosewisely.co.uk/ccLoader.js"></script>
```

## Configuration Settings
ccBundle accepts the object `clearChoice_conf` as configuration with the following options.

## Layout
Higher conversion rates can be expected if you run the application on a stand alone page with minimal navigation and no footer. This also requires the minimum level of styling work to get running. For a working example [see Choose Wisely's own form](https://www.choosewisely.co.uk/loans/short-term-loan-search/apply)


## Styling

[See a basic demo here](https://jsfiddle.net/ratio/1aq4up3j/) where the colors have been changed.

[This more advanced demo](https://jsfiddle.net/ratio/xr2n8675/) shows how you can lay out the multi choice boxes in a grid.

The form and results have their own stylesheets and a set of basic styles. The stylesheets are loaded asynchronously using javascript to prevent any render blocking by the browser. This stylesheets are prepended to the top of the `<head/>` tag. To override the default styles you will need to modify your sites stylesheets.


### Themes
The form and results have a list of prestyled themes that can be applied, use a theme name from the table below in your form settings configuration.

| Name             | Decription                                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `ChooseWisely`   | Styled to look like the default Choose Wisely form |

### CSS
The form is wrapped in the class `.ccAppForm`, all form elements are prefixed with this class e.g. `.ccAppForm--button`.
The comparison results are wrapped in `.ccAppResults`, and all result elements are prefixed with this class e.g. `.ccAppResults--result--button`.
This is to prevent the forms styles from affecting other elements on your site. Below are some example selectors.

#### Form Validation 

```css
/* Valid */
.ccAppForm .ccAppForm--button--success {
  background-color: green;
  border-color: green;
  color: #fff;
}

.ccAppForm .ccAppForm--success {
  color: green;
  border-color: green;
}


/* Error */
.ccAppForm .ccAppForm--button--error {
  background-color: red;
  border-color: red;
  color: #fff;
}

.ccAppForm .ccAppForm--error {
  color: red;
  border-color: red;
}
```


#### Buttons

```css
.ccAppForm .ccAppForm--button--primary {
  background-color: #007bff;
  border-color: #007bff;
  color: #fff;
}
```

```css
.ccAppResults .ccAppResults--result--button {
  background-color: #007bff;
  border-color: #007bff;
  color: #fff;
}
```

## Comparison Results
After your visitors complete the form you now have the option to show them the Choose Wisely powered comparison table where we will have matched them with their best available options directly on your site.


### Modes
There are two journey options for a customer once they submit the form. The customer can redirect through to Choose Wisely
for their application process and their unique set of comparison results. Or the application process and their comparison table of results can be displayed directly on your site within the `elemId` element.

| Name        | Decription                                         |
| ------------| -------------------------------------------------- |
| `Redirect`  | Once the form is submitted, the user will redirect to Choose Wisely to display the results of their application.                                                                      |
| `Results`   | Once the form is submitted, the user will be presented with the application submission process, after which, their application results will be presented all within the same element. |

### Example Responses & Events

#### Applicant Event
Pass the customer form data into the `detail` part of the event object in the [Choose Wisely White Label Results API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Ratio4/choosewisely-white-label-resuts/1.02) format.
 
```js
