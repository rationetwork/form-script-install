# Clear Choice Setup 

Get set up with a form and / or results that you can use to introduce your site's visitors to Choose Wiselyâ€™s award winning personal loan comparison service.

- No API calls.
- No iframes.
- No REST responses.

The application can work in 2 modes, both of which allow your visitors' needs to be matched against a comparison table showing their best available options.

- Redirect mode. After completing the form the visitor is redirected to the Choose Wisely site where a comparison table of results is displayed.
- Results mode. After completing the form a comparison table is fetched which is displayed directly on your own site.  
<br />

## Get Started
Your code snippet comes in two parts. 
### Part 1, Container Tag
Paste this where you want the form to run on your site.

```html
<div id="ccApply"></div>
```

### Part 2, The Script
Paste this just before the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
    <script type="text/javascript">
      window.clearChoice_conf = window.clearChoice_conf || {};
      clearChoice_conf = {
        key: 'your-affiliate-key-goes-here',
        ref: 'your-affiliate-reference-goes-here', // Optional
        elemId: 'ccApply', // Container tag id
	theme: 'ChooseWisely' // Optional
      };
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://3pi.choosewisely.co.uk/ccLoader.js"></script>
```
<br />

## Configuration Settings
ccBundle accepts the object `clearChoice_conf` as configuration with the following options.

## Layout
Higher conversion rates can be expected if you run the application on a stand alone page with minimal navigation and no footer. This also requires the minimum level of styling work to get running. For a working example [see Choose Wisely's own form](https://www.choosewisely.co.uk/loans/short-term-loan-search/apply)

<br />

## Styling

[See a basic demo here](https://jsfiddle.net/ratio/1aq4up3j/) where the colors have been changed.

[This more advanced demo](https://jsfiddle.net/ratio/xr2n8675/) shows how you can lay out the multi choice boxes in a grid.

The form and results have their own stylesheets and a set of basic styles. These stylesheets are loaded asynchronously using javascript to prevent any render blocking by the browser. This stylesheets are prepended to the top of the `<head/>` tag. To override the default styles you will need to modify your sites stylesheets.


### Themes
The form and results have a list of prestyled themes that can be applied, use a theme name from the table below in your form settings configuration.

| Name             | Description                                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `ChooseWisely`   | Styled to look like the default Choose Wisely form |

### Css
The form is wrapped in the class `.ccAppForm`, all form elements are prefixed with this class e.g. `.ccAppForm--button`.
The comparison results are wrapped in the class `.ccAppResults`, and all result elements are also prefixed with this class e.g. `.ccAppResults--result--button`.
When the viewport width is >= `800px` the comparison results also include the `.ccAppResults-dt` wrapper class. 

This is to prevent the forms styles from affecting other elements on your site. Below are some example selectors.

#### Form Validation 

```css
/* Valid */
.ccAppForm .ccAppForm--button--success {
  background-color: green;
  border-color: green;
  color: #fff;
}

.ccAppForm .ccAppForm--success {
  color: green;
  border-color: green;
}


/* Error */
.ccAppForm .ccAppForm--button--error {
  background-color: red;
  border-color: red;
  color: #fff;
}

.ccAppForm .ccAppForm--error {
  color: red;
  border-color: red;
}
```

#### Result Accept Row
```css
.ccAppResults--result--card {
  border-radius: .25rem;
  border: .125rem solid green;
  box-shadow: 0 5px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}
```

#### Buttons

```css
.ccAppForm .ccAppForm--button--primary {
  background-color: #007bff;
  border-color: #007bff;
  color: #fff;
}
```

```css
.ccAppResults .ccAppResults--result--button {
  background-color: #007bff;
  border-color: #007bff;
  color: #fff;
}
```
<br />

## Comparison Results
After your visitors complete the form you now have the option to show them the Choose Wisely powered comparison table where we will have matched them with their best available options directly on your site.


### Modes
There are two journey options for a customer once they submit the form. The customer can redirect through to Choose Wisely
for their application process and their unique set of comparison results. Or the application process and their comparison table of results can be displayed directly on your site within the `elemId` element.

| Name        | Description                                         |
| ------------| -------------------------------------------------- |
| `Redirect`  | Once the form is submitted, the user will redirect to Choose Wisely to display the results of their application.                                                                      |
| `Results`   | Once the form is submitted, the user will be presented with the application submission process, after which, their application results will be presented all within the same element. |

### Integration Methods
There are two integration methods for showing the comparison results on your site **[form and results]** and **[results only]**.

#### Form and results
This is the integration method for using both the form and the comparison results on your site,
once the form is submitted, the user will see a progress screen whilst the applicant data is being sent to providers,
once a response is returned, the progress screen will change to their comparison table of results. 

#### Results only
This is the integration method when using your existing site form, submitting your applicant data and then displaying the comparison table of results on your site.
Using this integration method the application will be loaded in a dormant state, it will only render and display the comparison results once it receives data,
either from an incoming event or when passed an applicant or response payload via the `clearChoice_conf` configuration object.  

### Example Responses & Events

#### Applicant Event
Pass the customer form data into the `detail` part of the event object in the [Choose Wisely White Label Results API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Ratio4/choosewisely-white-label-results) format.
